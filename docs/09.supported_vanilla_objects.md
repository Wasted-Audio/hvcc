# Supported vanilla objects

These are all the objects that hvcc is able to parse.

You can read more about limitations in the [getting started](02.getting_started.md#known-limitations) guide.

Here is a list of [unsupported Pd objects](10.unsupported_vanilla_objects.md).

## `-p` Search Paths

`hvcc` will iterate through various directories when resolving patch objects and abstractions. The `-p` or `--search_paths` argument can be used to add additional folders for `hvcc` to look in.

This can be handy when using a third-party patch library such as [heavylib](https://github.com/Wasted-Audio/heavylib).

```bash
hvcc ~/myProject/_main.pd -o ~/Desktop/somewhere/else/ -n mySynth -p ~/Workspace/Projects/Enzien/heavylib/ ~/Desktop/myLib/
```
