# DPF

Heavy can generate LV2 and VST2 plugins from your patch using the [Distrho Plugin Framework](https://github.com/DISTRHO/DPF). It can be either a synth (output-only) or an effect (input and output), supports an arbitrary number of parameters, and can process midi events.

## Defining Parameters
Each [exposed parameter](02.getting_started.md#exposing-parameters) will automatically generate a slider in the plugin interface.

## MIDI Control
In order to receive MIDI note on and off events, as well as control change messages, the `[notein]` and `[ctlin]` objects should be used, respectively.

## Parameter Types
In DPF a parameter can get an optional type configured. The default type is `float`. Other assignable types are `bool` - for toggling a value - and `trig` - for momentary signals.

The following dpf jinja templating:

```jinja
        parameter.hints = kParameterIsAutomable
      {% if v.attributes.type == 'bool': %}
        | kParameterIsBoolean
      {% elif v.attributes.type == 'trig': %}
        | kParameterIsTrigger
      {% endif %};
```

Generates the subsequent plugin code:

```c++
        parameter.hints = kParameterIsAutomable | kParameterIsBoolean;
// or
        parameter.hints = kParameterIsAutomable | kParameterIsTrigger;
```

## Metadata

An accomponying metadata.json file can be included to set additional plugin settings.

The `project` flag creates a `README.md` and `Makefile` in the root of the project output, but may conflict with other generators.

Each of these are optional and have either a default value or are entirely optional (description and homepage). Midi i/o ports are on by default, but can be set to `0` and they will be disabled - currently `midi_input` always has to be on!.


```json
{
    "dpf": {
        "project": true,
        "description": "super simple test patch",
        "maker": "nobody",
        "homepage": "https://wasted.audio/plugin/dpf_example",
        "plugin_uri": "lv2://wasted.audio/lv2/dpf_example",
        "version": "6, 6, 6",
        "license": "WTFPL",
        "midi_input": 1,
        "midi_output": 0,
        "plugin_formats": [
            "lv2_dsp",
            "vst",
            "jack"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Notes
* The `[notein]` object is the only supported means of receiving MIDI note events (i.e. Note On and Note Off). Arguments to the object (e.g. to specify the channel number) will be ignored.
* The `[ctlin]` object is the only supported means of receiving MIDI control change events. Arguments to the object (e.g. to filter which CC event is delivered) will be ignored.
* If you are compiling from source, make sure to read the included `README.md` file in the root directory.
