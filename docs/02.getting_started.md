# Getting Started

## Audio Input/Output

To receive audio input into your patch add an `[adc~]` object.

To send audio output add a `[dac~]` The number of channels can be configured by providing arguments to object. For example `[dac~ 1 2 3]` will generate three output channels. `[adc~ 1]` will make a single channel of audio input.

Note that top-level graphs (e.g. `_main.pd`) should not have any `[inlet~]` or `[outlet~]` objects. These are reserved only for abstractions.

> NOTE: Currently if your main patch does not have at least an `adc~` or `dac~` configured signal rate objects will not be evaluated in the graph!

## Exposing Parameters

### Input Parameters

All (control) `[receive]` and `[r]` objects annotated with `@hv_param` will be exposed as **input** parameters in each framework. The name provided will propagate through to the plugin interface.

For example, `[r gain @hv_param 0 1 0.5]` will show up as "gain", with a minimum value of 0, a maximum value of 1, and a default value of 0.5. If a patch has multiple exposed receivers with the same name, they must all have the same minimum, maximum, and default values as well.

Receivers not annotated with `@hv_param` are still completely functional, they simply will not be exported to the framework interface.

### Parameter Type

An optional parameter type can be set to which generator implementations can program custom features. The default type is `float`.

For example, `[r toggle @hvparam 0 1 1 bool]`.

See the [DPF docs](03.gen.dpf.md#parameter-types) for more information on how parameter types can be integrated into a generator.

### Output Parameters

In the same manner as above, all (control) `[send]` and `[s]` objects annotated with `@hv_param` will be exposed as **output** parameters.

For example, `[s envelope @hv_param]`.

Messages passed to these send objects can be forwarded on to other parts of the application. This is useful for creating audio-driven behaviours or extracting analysis information.

See the specific framework details for more information on output parameter support and integration details.

## Exposing Events

All (control) `[receive]` and `[r]` objects annotated with `@hv_event` will be exposed as events in the Unity and Javascript targets only.

For example, `[r bang @hv_event]` will show up as a button called "bang" in the Unity Editor interface.

See the [Unity docs](03.gen.unity.md#exposing-and-sending-events) for more information on exposing events and controlling them.

## Metadata

Some generators, like Daisy and DPF, enable support for extra configuration metadata.json file using the `-m`. It depends on the generator what is supported. See the [DPF docs](03.gen.dpf.md#metadata) for more information on setting meta data for plugins.

Simple Daisy example that selects the desired board to build for:

```json
{
    "daisy": {
        "board": "seed"
    }
}
```

## Errors

If there's an incompatibility within the patch, Heavy will generate an error message.

## Warnings

Heavy will also perform patch analysis to look for common mistakes and inconsitencies between Pd and heavy behaviour. The targets will still be generated correctly but it might be useful information for example when cleaning up the patch.

## Reporting Issues

If you experience any problems or have some thoughts on how to improve heavy make sure to browse and contribute to our [public issue tracker](https://github.com/Wasted-Audio/hvcc/issues).

## Tips and Tricks

Just because pd-vanilla can run your patch, does not mean it will behave exactly the same using Heavy. Extra care needs to be taken when dealing with control messages and certain PD object features.

* Make sure to go over the [known limitations](#known-limitations) to see if you are using objects incorrectly.
* Try to move as much of your patch into the signal domain as you can. Heavy is optimized for signal processing and every control rate operation can introduce interruptions and additional delay. Use control logic at the very beginning or the very end of the dataflow if possible.
* Make sure the order in your control flow works as intended. Use `[t]`/trigger objects to force the correct order of operations.
* When using Daisy the receive objects continuously output control messages, which can potentially interrupt your intended behavior.
* If you run into problems with a patch try to reduce it in order to localize the problem to a specific object or use-case before reporting an issue.

## Known Limitations

This list will be continuously epanded to document differences in object behavior between PD and Heavy.

* Many objects do not take control signals on their left inlet. `[osc~]` for instance always requires the use of `[sig~]` before connecting a value.
* Heavy does not support symbols in `[pack]`. e.g. `[pack s f]`.
* Heavy does not support numbers in `[unpack]`, e.g. `[unpack 0 0]` gives `Heavy only supports arguments 'f' and 's' to unpack.` Workaround is to use `f` instead, e.g. `[unpack f f]`, and if necessary prime the default values with a `[loadbang]` and `[0 0(`.
* Sliders and number inputs are converted to `[f ]` and thus do not store send/receive/initialization/etc. settings.
* Heavy does not accept arguments and control connections to: `[rzero~]`, `[rzero_rev~]`, `[czero~]`, `[czero_rev~]`. In Heavy, these objects accept only signal inputs. Arguments and control connections are ignored.
* On the `[select]` object it is currently not possible to set the arguments via the right inlet (internally a hardcoded switch_case is used).
* Heavy supports remote/send messages, however empty messages are currently removed. So the typical `[; bla 1(` multiline message needs to contain at least something on the first line: `[_; bla 1(`.
* `[metro]` and `[timer]` objects do not accept tempo messages or unit arguments.
* `[snapshot~]` does not respond within the same control flow as it executes in signal context. Its output happens on the next audio cycle, so additional care for this control flow needs to be taken into account if you depend on synchronous execution.
* Certain filters are sensitive to ‘blowing up’ at very low or very high cutoff frequencies and/or resonances, due to the filter coefficients not being perfectly represented with a finite number of bits. While Pure data natively uses 64 bits, platforms like `OWL` and `Daisy`  that use 32 bit float are more sensitive to this. For example, the Pure data `[bp~]` filter is implemented with a biquad which is prone to fail or distort with cutoff frequencies less than around 200 Hz (at 48kHz sample rate).
* Heavy does not support multichannel connections.
