Daisy is an embedded platform for music. It features everything you need for creating high fidelity audio hardware devices.

This Generator is typically it is used in combination with [pd2dsy](https://github.com/electro-smith/pd2dsy).

Currently daisy platform is supported for:

* `field`
* `seed`
* `pod`
* `petal`
* `patch`

Which can be configured using the `-m` metadata.json `daisy.board` setting:

```json
{
    "daisy": {
        "board": "seed"
    }
}
```

However one can also create custom board layouts. See the pd2dsy documentation for more information.
