# OWL

The main project output for this generator can be found in  `<output_dir>/owl/`.

## implementation

This generator uses some separate "raw" code paths to link the DSP graph. Instead of `@hv_param` currently `@raw` and `@raw_param` are used.

Legacy `@owl` and `@owl_param` are still functional for backwards compatibility.

It currently also overloads `HvMessage.c` and `HvUtils.h` with some different optimizations for this target.
