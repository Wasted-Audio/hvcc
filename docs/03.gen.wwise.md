# Wwise

This is a work-in-progress document.

## Installing Development Version of Heavy

Heavy is written in Python. You need to install a development package in order to test new Wwise plugin generator.

1. Install Python 3, any recent version will work
2. Download in-progress source code from this fork: <https://github.com/eu-ch/hvcc/>
3. From terminal, navigate to download dir and run the following command:
   ```
   pip install -U hvcc-develop.zip
   ```

The rest is the official documentation.

------------------------------------------

## Version Support

`hvcc` will generate a Wwise plugin project that can be built with Audiokinetic's build system, see [Using the Development Tools](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/library/edge/?source=SDK&id=effectplugin_tools.html). This system can generate project files for all supported platforms, as well as package the plugin for distribution with Wwise Launcher. Please refere to the official documentation for more details.

To build Authoring and Engine plugins on Windows you'll need:

- Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 with the following components installed:
  - Desktop development with C++ workload
  - C++ MFC
  - C++ ATL
  - Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041.0)
    - Different version can be specified in a generated
      PremakePlugin.lua file
- Wwise 2022 or later
  - Version 2021 should work, too, but it wasn't tested
  - SDK with required deployment platforms must be installed through
    Wwise Launcher

## Feature Overview

Heavy currently supports the following Wwise features:

- Source or Effect plugins
- Using uncompressed audio to build samplers
- Input parameters are RTPC-controllable
- Output parameters can set RTPC in Wwise
- Output events can post arbitrary events in Wwise from the plugin

## Source Generator or FX Unit

The type of plugin that **heavy** generates is dynamically determined depending on the [I/O channel configuration](02.getting_started.md#audio-input-output). If an `[adc~]` object exists in the patch the generated plugin with be an FX unit. Otherwise it'll be a source generator plugin.

## RTPCs

The Wwise target supports both [input and output parameters](02.getting_started.md#exposing-parameters).

![](img/docs_wwise_params.png)

### Input Parameters

Exposing an input parameter will automatically generate a Slider UI in the plugin interface, that can then be connected to RTPCs from your game.

### Output Parameters

Sending a `single float value` to an output parameters will in turn cause the corresponding RTPC of the same name to be set. It will be set on the same game object. **Note**: it's important that the naming of the output parameter and the global RTPC set up in Wwise are exactly the same.

The example patch below describes a simple envelope follower that can be used to modulate other parameters of the same voice:

![Envelope follower with an output RTPC](img/docs_wwise_env.png)

### Posting Wwise Events from the Plugin

Sending any message to an output event will post a Wwise event with the same name on the same game object. This can be used, for example, to trigger events in Wwise in response to RTPC changes, or to implement a generative event triggering system.

Note, in some situations, Heavy may only be able to send one output message per tick, e.g. posting an event and setting an RTPC at the same time won't be possible. To work around this, you can spread these actions apart with a `[delay 1]` node, for example.

### Multi-channel plugins

The plugin supports the following channel configurations:

- AK_SPEAKER_SETUP_MONO
- AK_SPEAKER_SETUP_STEREO
- AK_SPEAKER_SETUP_5POINT1
- AK_SPEAKER_SETUP_7POINT1
- AK_SPEAKER_SETUP_DOLBY_7_1_4

An appropriate configuration will be selected at compile time based on the number of inputs and outputs in a patch (e.g. `[adc~ 1 2 3 4 5 6]` will create a 5.1 plugin). As this information is compiled in, the plugins can only be used on busses with corresponding channel configurations and will print an error if used elsewhere. To work around this, you can enforce bus channel configuration in the 'General Settings' tab.

## Example of Building Your Plugin on Windows

### Converting a Pure Data Patch to C++ Code

Let's say we've got a Pd patch HvccTestFX71.pd which was saved on a Desktop. These commands will generate code for this patch and place it in *Hvcc_Out_Dir* directory:

```cmd
cd C:\Users\login\Desktop
hvcc HvccTestFX71.pd -o Hvcc_Out_Dir -g wwise -n HvccTestFX71
```

### Building C++ Code

Heavy generates a project compatible with Audiokinetic's [Development Tools](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/library/edge/?source=SDK&id=effectplugin_tools.html), which can build the plugins for all supported platforms, see the documentation for more details. **Important:** Please close any running Wwise Authoring instance as it'll prevent the plugin from being built.

Change into the generated directory:

```cmd
cd Hvcc_Out_Dir\wwise
```

Generate Visual Studio project files; note, WWISEROOT environment variable can be set from Wwise Launcher by clicking on *Set Environment Variables* button in front of an installed Wwise entry:

```cmd
python %WWISEROOT%\Scripts\Build\Plugins\wp.py premake Authoring
python %WWISEROOT%\Scripts\Build\Plugins\wp.py premake Windows_vc160
```

Build Authoring and Engine plugins in Release configurations; for Visual Studio 2022 replace vc160 with vc170:

```cmd
python %WWISEROOT%\Scripts\Build\Plugins\wp.py build -c Release -x x64 -t vc160 Authoring
python %WWISEROOT%\Scripts\Build\Plugins\wp.py build -c Release -x x64 -t vc160 Windows_vc160
```

At this point the plugins should be already in the correct SDK directories and be ready for use in the Authoring app.

### Optional: Packaging the Binaries for Wwise Launcher

We can go a step further and package the plugins into a bundle that can be installed conveniently from Wwise Launcher.

```cmd
python %WWISEROOT%\Scripts\Build\Plugins\wp.py package --version 2022.1.0.1 Authoring
python %WWISEROOT%\Scripts\Build\Plugins\wp.py package --version 2022.1.0.1 Windows_vc160
python %WWISEROOT%\Scripts\Build\Plugins\wp.py generate-bundle --version 2022.1.0.1
mkdir Bundle
copy /y bundle.json Bundle
copy /y *.tar.xz Bundle
```

The *Bundle* directory now contains a packaged plugin you can install through Wwise Launcher, see Wwise Version -> Manage Plug-ins -> Install from directory / Install from archive.
